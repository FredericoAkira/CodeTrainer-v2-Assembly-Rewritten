# CodeTrainer-v2-Assembly-Rewriten

Hello, thank you for using CodeTrainer version 2's other remastered versions/remakes. This application is for those who want a slighlty different test with having A, B, or C as answers and the application being bigger. This application was made for a challenge reason. Below, i have answered some questions as i did with Lost Woods too. (If you haven't checked Lost Woods out yet, please do!)

1. This project does not solve any problems, but this project is for those who want a slighlty different quiz than the other CodeTrainer versions and a bigger one being around 1150 lines of code.

2. I chose Windows to pursue this application because i only know the Windows version of Assembly and thought it could be fun.

3. I also considered making it multiplatformed, but considering my time and pace i rejected it because i only had 3 hours to make this. I finished the entire project in 2 hours.
